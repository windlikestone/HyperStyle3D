  """Image warping using correspondences between sparse control points.

  Apply a non-linear warp to the image, where the warp is specified by
  the source and destination locations of a (potentially small) number of
  control points. First, we use a polyharmonic spline
  (`tf.contrib.image.interpolate_spline`) to interpolate the displacements
  between the corresponding control points to a dense flow field.
  Then, we warp the image using this dense flow field
  (`tf.contrib.image.dense_image_warp`).

  Let t index our control points. For regularization_weight=0, we have:
  warped_image[b, dest_control_point_locations[b, t, 0],
                  dest_control_point_locations[b, t, 1], :] =
  image[b, source_control_point_locations[b, t, 0],
           source_control_point_locations[b, t, 1], :].

  For regularization_weight > 0, this condition is met approximately, since
  regularized interpolation trades off smoothness of the interpolant vs.
  reconstruction of the interpolant at the control points.
  See `tf.contrib.image.interpolate_spline` for further documentation of the
  interpolation_order and regularization_weight arguments.


  Args:
    image: `[batch, height, width, channels]` float `Tensor`
    source_control_point_locations: `[batch, num_control_points, 2]` float
      `Tensor`
    dest_control_point_locations: `[batch, num_control_points, 2]` float
      `Tensor`
    interpolation_order: polynomial order used by the spline interpolation
    regularization_weight: weight on smoothness regularizer in interpolation
    num_boundary_points: How many zero-flow boundary points to include at
      each image edge.Usage:
        num_boundary_points=0: don't add zero-flow points
        num_boundary_points=1: 4 corners of the image
        num_boundary_points=2: 4 corners and one in the middle of each edge
          (8 points total)
        num_boundary_points=n: 4 corners and n-1 along each edge
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

    Note that image and offsets can be of type tf.half, tf.float32, or
    tf.float64, and do not necessarily have to be the same type.

  Returns:
    warped_image: `[batch, height, width, channels]` float `Tensor` with same
      type as input image.
    flow_field: `[batch, height, width, 2]` float `Tensor` containing the dense
